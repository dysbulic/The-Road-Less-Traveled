<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">As human beings grow in discipline and love and life experience, their understanding of the world and their place in it naturally grows apace. Conversely, as people fail to grow in discipline, love and life experience, so does their understanding fail to grow. Consequently, among the members of the human race there exists an extraordinary variability in the breadth and sophistication of our understanding of what life is all about.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">This understanding is our religion. Since everyone has some understanding—some world view, no matter how limited or primitive or inaccurate—everyone has a religion. This fact, not widely recognized, is of the utmost importance: everyone has a religion.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">We suffer, I believe, from a tendency to define religion too narrowly. We tend to think that religion must include a belief in God or some ritualistic practice or membership in a worshiping group. We are likely to say of someone who does not attend church or believe in a superior being, “He or she is not religious.” I have even heard scholars say such things as: “Buddhism is not really a religion” or “Unitarians have excluded religion from their faith” or “Mysticism is more a philosophy than a religion.” We tend to view religion as something monolithic, cut out of whole cloth, and then, with this simplistic concept, we are puzzled as to how two very different people can both call themselves Christians. Or Jews. Or how an atheist might have a more highly developed sense of Christian morality than a Catholic who routinely attends mass.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">In supervising other psychotherapists I rather routinely find that they pay too little, if any, attention to the ways in which their patients view the world. There are several reasons for this, but among them is the notion that if patients don’t consider themselves religious by virtue of their belief in God or their church membership, they are lacking in religion and the matter therefore needs no further scrutiny. But the fact of the matter is that everyone has an explicit or implicit set of ideas and beliefs as to the essential nature of the world. Do patients envision the universe as basically chaotic and without meaning so that it is only sensible for them to grab whatever little pleasure they can whenever it is available? Do they see the world as a dog-eat-dog place where ruthlessness is essential for their survival? Or do they see it as a nurturing sort of place in which something good will always turn up and in which they need not fret much about the future? Or a place that owes them a living no matter how they conduct their lives? Or a universe of rigid law in which they will be struck down and cast away if they step even slightly out of line? Et cetera. There are all manner of different world views that people have. Sooner or later in the course of psychotherapy most therapists will come to recognize how a patient views the world, but if the therapist is specifically on the lookout for it, he or she will come to this recognition sooner rather than later. And it is essential that therapists arrive at this knowledge, for the world view of patients is always an essential part of their problems, and a correction in their world view is necessary for their cure. So I say to those I supervise: “Find out your patients’ religions even if they say they don’t have any.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Usually a person’s religion or world view is at best only incompletely conscious. Patients are often unaware of how they view the world, and sometimes may even think they possess a certain kind of religion when they actually are possessed by a far different kind. Stewart, a successful industrial engineer, became severely depressed in his mid-fifties. Despite his success at work and the fact that he had been an exemplary husband and father, he felt worthless and evil. “The world would be a better place if I were dead,” he said. And meant it. Stewart had made two extremely serious suicide attempts. No amount of realistic reassurance could interrupt the unrealism of his worthless self-image. As well as the usual symptoms of a severe depression, such as insomnia and agitation, Stewart also suffered great difficulty in swallowing his food. “It’s not just that the food tastes bad,” he said. “That, too. But it’s as if there’s a blade of steel stuck straight in my throat and nothing but liquid can get by it.” Special X-rays and tests failed to reveal a physical cause for his difficulty. Stewart made no bones about his religion. “I’m an atheist, plain and simple,” he stated. “I’m a scientist. The only things I believe in are those things you can see and touch. Maybe I’d be better off if I had some kind of faith in a sweet and loving God, but, frankly, I can’t stomach that kind of crap. I had enough of it when I was a child and I’m glad I’ve gotten away from it.” Stewart had grown up in a small Midwestern community, the son of a rigid fundamentalist preacher and his equally rigid and fundamentalist wife, and had left home and church at the first opportunity.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Several months after he entered treatment Stewart recounted the following brief dream: “It was back in my childhood home in Minnesota. It was like I was still living there as a child, yet I also knew I was the same age as I am now. It was nighttime. A man had entered the house. He was going to cut our throats. I had never seen this man before, but strangely I knew who he was: the father of a girl I had dated a couple of times in high school. That was all. There was no conclusion. I just woke up fearful, knowing that this man wanted to cut our throats.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">I asked Stewart to tell me everything he could about this man in his dream. “There’s really nothing I can tell you,” he said. “I never met the man. I only dated his daughter a couple of times—not really dates, just walking her home to her door after church youth group meetings. I did steal a kiss from her in the dark behind some bushes on one of those walks.” Here Stewart gave a little nervous laugh and went on, “In my dream I had the sense I’d never seen her father, although I knew who he was. Actually, in real life I did see him—from a distance. He was the stationmaster for our town. Occasionally I would see him when I used to go to the station and watch the trains come in on summer afternoons.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Something clicked in my mind. I too as a child had spent lazy summer afternoons watching the trains go by. The train station was where the action was. And the stationmaster was the Director of the Action. He knew the distant places from which the great trains were coming to touch our little town and the faraway places to which they were going. He knew which trains would stop and which would roar through, shaking the earth as they went. He worked the switches, the signals. He received the mail and sent it off. And when he was not doing these wonderful things he sat in his office doing something more wonderful: tapping on a magical little key in a mysterious rhythmical language, sending messages out to the whole world.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Stewart,” I said, “you have told me that you’re an atheist, and I believe you. There is a part of your mind that believes there is no God. But I am beginning to suspect that there is another part of your mind that does believe in God—a dangerous, cutthroat God.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">My suspicion was correct. Gradually, as we worked together, reluctantly, striving against resistance, Stewart began to recognize within himself a strange and ugly faith: an assumption, beyond his atheism, that the world was controlled and directed by a malevolent force, a force that not only could cut his throat but that was eager to do so, eager to punish him for transgressions. Slowly also we began to focus on his “transgressions,” mostly minor sexual incidents symbolized by his “stealing a kiss” from the stationmaster’s daughter. Eventually it became clear that (among other reasons for his depression) Stewart was doing penance and figuratively cutting his own throat in the hope that by so doing he could prevent God from literally cutting it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Where did Stewart’s notion of a vicious God and a malevolent world come from? How do people’s religions develop? What determines a person’s particular world view? There are whole complexes of determinants, and this book will not explore the question in depth. But the most important factor in the development of the religion of most people is obviously their culture. If we are European we are likely to believe that Christ was a white man, and if we are African that he was a black man. If one is an Indian who was born and raised in Benares or Bombay, one is likely to become a Hindu and possess what has been described as a pessimistic world view. If one is an American born and raised in Indiana, one is more likely to become a Christian than a Hindu and to possess a somewhat more optimistic world view. We tend to believe what the people around us believe, and we tend to accept as truth what these people tell us of the nature of the world as we listen to them during our formative years.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">But less obvious (except to psychotherapists) is the fact that the most important part of our culture is our particular family. The most basic culture in which we develop is the culture of our family, and our parents are its “culture leaders.” Moreover, the most significant aspect of that culture is not what our parents tell us about God and the nature of things but rather what they do—how they behave toward each other, toward our siblings and, above all, toward us. In other words, what we learn about the nature of the world when we are growing up is determined by the actual nature of our experience in the microcosm of the family. It is not so much what our parents say that determines our world view as it is the unique world they create for us by their behavior. “I agree that I have this notion of a cutthroat God,” Stewart said, “but where did it come from? My parents certainly believed in God—they talked about it incessantly—but theirs was a God of Love. Jesus loves us. God loves us. We love God and Jesus. Love, love, love, that’s all I ever heard.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Did you have a happy childhood?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Stewart glared at me. “Stop playing dumb,” he said. “You know I didn’t. You know it was miserable.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Why was it miserable?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You know that too. You know what it was like. I got the shit beaten out of me. Belts, boards, brooms, brushes, anything they could lay their hands on. There wasn’t anything I could do that didn’t merit a beating. A beating a day keeps the doctor away and makes a good little Christian out of you.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Did they ever try to strangle you or cut your throat?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“No, but I’m sure they would have if I hadn’t been careful.” There was a long moment of silence. Stewart’s face became extremely depressed. Finally, heavily, he said, “I’m beginning to understand.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Stewart was not the only person who believed in what I have come to call the “monster-god.” I have had a number of patients with similar concepts of God and similarly bleak or terrifying notions as to the nature of existence. What is surprising is that the monster-god is not more common in the minds of humans. In the first section of this book it was noted that when we are children our parents are godlike figures to our child’s eye, and the way they do things seems the way they must be done throughout the universe. Our first (and, sadly, often our only) notion of God’s nature is a simple extrapolation of our parents’ natures, a simple blending of the characters of our mothers and fathers or their substitutes. If we have loving, forgiving parents, we are likely to believe in a loving and forgiving God. And in our adult view the world is likely to seem as nurturing a place as our childhood was. If our parents were harsh and punitive, we are likely to mature with a concept of a harsh and punitive monster-god. And if they failed to care for us, we will likely envision the universe as similarly uncaring. *</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre11">* Frequently (but not always) the essence of a patient’s childhood and hence the essence of his or her world view is captured in the “earliest memory.” Consequently I will often ask patients, “Tell me the very first thing that you can remember.” They may protest that they cannot do this, that they have a number of early memories. But when I force them to make a choice of one, the response will vary in flavor from “Well, I remember my mother picking me up and carrying me outside in her arms to show me a beautiful sunset” to “I remember sitting on the floor of the kitchen. I had wet my pants and my mother was standing over me waving a big spoon in the air and screaming at me.” It is probable that these first memories, like the phenomenon of screen memories, which they so often are, are remembered precisely because they accurately symbolize the nature of a person’s early childhood. It is not surprising, then, that the flavor of these earliest memories is so frequently the same as that of a patient’s deepest feelings about the nature of existence.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre11"></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">The fact that our religion or world view is initially largely determined by our unique childhood experience brings us face to face with a central problem: the relationship between religion and reality. It is the problem of the microcosm and the macrocosm. Stewart’s view of the world as a dangerous place where he would get his throat cut if he wasn’t very careful was perfectly realistic in terms of the microcosm of his childhood home; he lived under the domination of two vicious adults. But all parents are not vicious and all adults are not vicious. In the larger world, the macrocosm, there are many different kinds of parents and people and societies and cultures.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">To develop a religion or world view that is realistic—that is, conforms to the reality of the cosmos and our role in it, as best we can know that reality—we must constantly revise and extend our understanding to include new knowledge of the larger world. We must constantly enlarge our frame of reference. We are dealing here with the issues of map-making and transference, which were discussed at some length in the first section. Stewart’s map of reality was accurate for the microcosm of his family, but he had transferred that map inappropriately into a larger adult world, where it was grossly incomplete and hence defective. To some extent the religion of most adults is a product of transference.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Most of us operate from a narrower frame of reference than that of which we are capable, failing to transcend the influence of our particular culture, our particular set of parents and our particular childhood experience upon our understanding. It is no wonder, then, that the world of humanity is so full of conflict. We have a situation in which human beings, who must deal with each other, have vastly different views as to the nature of reality, yet each one believes his or her own view to be the correct one since it is based on the microcosm of personal experience. And to make matters worse, most of us are not even fully aware of our own world views, much less the uniqueness of the experience from which they are derived. Bryant Wedge, a psychiatrist specializing in the field of international relations, studied negotiations between the United States and the U.S.S.R. and was able to delineate a number of basic assumptions as to the nature of human beings and society and the world held by Americans which differed dramatically from the assumptions of Russians. These assumptions dictated the negotiating behavior of both sides. Yet neither side was aware of its own assumptions or the fact that the other side was operating on a different set of assumptions. The inevitable result was that the negotiating behavior of the Russians seemed to the Americans to be either crazy or deliberately evil, and of course the Americans seemed to the Russians equally crazy or evil. * </span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Spiritual growth is a journey out of the microcosm into an ever greater macrocosm. In its earlier stages (which is all this book concerns itself with) it is a journey of knowledge and not of faith. In order to escape the microcosm of our previous experience and free ourselves from transferences, it is necessary that we <span class="italic">learn</span>. We must continually expand our realm of knowledge and our field of vision through the thorough digestion and incorporation of new information. The process of expansion of knowledge has been a major theme of this book. It will be recalled that in the previous section love was defined as an extension—that is, an expansion—of ourselves, and it was noted that among the risks of love was the risk of moving into the unknown of new experience. And at the end of the first section on discipline it was also noted that the learning of something new requires a giving up of the old self and a death of outworn knowledge. To develop a broader vision we must be willing to forsake, to kill, our narrower vision. In the short run it is more comfortable not to do this—to stay where we are, to keep using the same microcosmic map, to avoid suffering the death of cherished notions. The road of spiritual growth, however, lies in the opposite direction. We begin by distrusting what we already believe, by actively seeking the threatening and unfamiliar, by deliberately challenging the validity of what we have previously been taught and hold dear. The path to holiness lies through questioning <span class="italic">everything</span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">In a very real sense, we begin with science. We begin by replacing the religion of our parents with the religion of science. We must rebel against and reject the religion of our parents, for inevitably their world view will be narrower than that of which we are capable if we take full advantage of our personal experience, including our adult experience and the experience of an additional generation of human history. There is no such thing as a good hand-me-down religion. To be vital, to be the best of which we are capable, our religion must be a wholly personal one, forged entirely through the fire of our questioning and doubting in the crucible of our own experience of reality. As the theologian Alan Jones has said: </span></span></span></p>

<blockquote class="calibre6"><p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">One of our problems is that very few of us have developed any distinctive personal life. Everything about us seems secondhand, even our emotions. In many cases we have to rely on secondhand information in order to function. I accept the word of a physician, a scientist, a farmer, on trust. I do not like to do this. I have to because they possess vital knowledge of living of which I am ignorant. Secondhand information concerning the state of my kidneys, the effects of cholesterol, and the raising of chickens, I can live with. But when it comes to questions of meaning, purpose, and death, secondhand information will not do. I cannot survive on a secondhand faith in a secondhand God. There has to be a personal word, a unique confrontation, if I am to come alive. *</span></span></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre11"></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">So for mental health and spiritual growth we must develop our own personal religion and not rely on that of our parents. But what is this about a “religion of science”? Science is a religion because it is a world view of considerable complexity with a number of major tenets. Most of these major tenets are as follows: the universe is real, and therefore a valid object for examination; it is of value for human beings to examine the universe; the universe makes sense—that is, it follows certain laws and is predictable; but human beings are poor examiners, subject to superstition, bias, prejudice, and a profound tendency to see what they want to see rather than what is really there; consequently, to examine and hence understand accurately, it is necessary for human beings to subject themselves to the discipline of scientific method. The essence of this discipline is experience, so that we cannot consider ourselves to know something unless we have actually experienced it; while the discipline of scientific method begins with experience, simple experience itself is not to be trusted; to be trusted, experience must be repeatable, usually in the form of an experiment; moreover, the experience must be verifiable, in that other people must have the same experience under the same circumstances.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">The key words are “reality,” “examination,” “knowledge,” “distrust,” “experience,” “discipline.” These are words we have been using all along. Science is a religion of skepticism. To escape from the microcosm of our childhood experience, from the microcosm of our culture and its dogmas, from the half-truths our parents told us, it is essential that we be skeptical about what we think we have learned to date. It is the scientific attitude that enables us to transform our personal experience of the microcosm into a personal experience of the macrocosm. We must begin by becoming scientists. Many patients who have already taken this beginning say to me: “I’m not religious. I don’t go to church. I no longer believe much of what the church and my parents told me. I don’t have my parents’ faith. I guess I’m not very spiritual.” It often comes as a shock to them when I question the reality of their assumption that they are not spiritual beings. “You have a religion,” I may say, “a rather profound one. You worship the truth. You believe in the possibility of your growth and betterment: the possibility of spiritual progress. In the strength of your religion you are willing to suffer the pains of challenge and the agonies of unlearning. You take the risk of therapy, and all this you do for the sake of your religion. I am not at all certain it is realistic to say that you are less spiritual than your parents; to the contrary, I suspect the reality is that you have spiritually evolved beyond your parents, that your spirituality is greater by a quantum leap than theirs, which is insufficient to provide them with even the courage to question.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">One thing to suggest that science as a religion represents an improvement, an evolutionary leap, over a number of other world views, is its international character. We speak of the worldwide scientific community. And it is beginning to approach a true community, to come considerably closer than the Catholic Church, which is probably the next closest thing to a true international brotherhood. Scientists of all lands are able, far better than most of the rest of us, to talk to each other. To some extent they have been successful in transcending the microcosm of their culture. To some extent they are becoming wise.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">To some extent. While I believe that the skeptical world view of the scientific-minded is a distinct improvement over a world view based upon blind faith, local superstition and unquestioned assumptions, I also believe that most of the scientific-minded have only barely begun the journey of spiritual growth. Specifically, I believe that the outlook of most scientific-minded people toward the reality of God is almost as parochial as the outlook of simple peasants who blindly follow the faith of their fathers. Scientists have grave difficulty dealing with the reality of God.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">When we look from our vantage of sophisticated skepticism at the phenomenon of belief in God we are not impressed. We see dogmatism, and proceeding from dogmatism, we see wars and inquisitions and persecutions. We see hypocrisy: people professing the brotherhood of man killing their fellows in the name of faith, lining their pockets at the expense of others, and practicing all manner of brutality. We see a bewildering multiplicity of rituals and images without consensus: this god is a woman with six arms and six legs; that is a man who sits on a throne; this one is an elephant; that one the essence of nothingness; pantheons, household gods, trinities, unities. We see ignorance, superstition, rigidity. The track record for belief in God looks pretty poor. It is tempting to think that humanity might be better off without a belief in God, that God is not only pie in the sky by and by, but a poisoned pie at that. It would seem reasonable to conclude that God is an illusion in the minds of humans—a destructive illusion—and that belief in God is a common form of human psychopathology that should be healed. So we have a question: Is belief in God a sickness? Is it a manifestation of transference—a concept of our parents, derived from the microcosm, inappropriately projected into the macrocosm? Or, to put it another way, is such belief a form of primitive or childish thinking which we should grow out of as we seek higher levels of awareness and maturity? We want to be scientific in attempting to answer this question, it is essential that we turn to the reality of actual clinical data. What happens to one’s belief in God as one grows through the process of psychotherapy? </span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Kathy was the most frightened person I have ever seen. When I came into her room that first time she was sitting on the floor in the comer muttering what sounded like a chant. She looked up at me standing in the doorway and her eyes grew wide with terror. She wailed and pushed herself back into the comer and kept straining against the walls as if she wished she could push herself through them. I said, “Kathy, I’m a psychiatrist. I’m not going to hurt you.” I took a chair, sat down at some distance from her and waited. For another minute she continued to push herself into the comer. Then she began to relax, but only enough to start weeping inconsolably. After a while her weeping stopped and she began to chant to herself again. I asked her what was wrong. “I’m going to die,” she blurted out hardly pausing to interrupt the cadence of her chant. There was nothing more she could tell rile. She continued to chant. Every five minutes or so she would stop, seemingly exhausted, whimper for a few moments, and, then resume her chanting. To whatever question I asked she would respond only with “I’m going to die,” never breaking the rhythm of the chant. It seemed that” she felt she might be able to prevent her death by this chanting and could not allow herself to rest or sleep.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">From her husband, Howard, a young policeman, I obtained the minimal facts. Kathy was twenty years old. They had been married for two years. There were no problems with the marriage. Kathy was close to her parents. She had never had any psychiatric difficulty before. This was a complete surprise. She had been perfectly fine that morning. She had driven him to work. Two hours later his sister called him. She had gone to visit Kathy and had found her in this condition. They had brought her to the hospital. No, she had not been acting strange lately. Except maybe for one thing. For about four months she had seemed quite fearful of going into public places. To help her Howard had been doing all the shopping in the supermarket while she waited in the car. She also seemed to be afraid of being left: alone. She prayed a lot—but, then, she had done that ever since he had known her. Her family was quite religious. Her mother went to mass at least twice a week. Funny thing—Kathy had stopped going to mass as soon as they were married. Which was just fine with him. But she still prayed a lot. Her physical health? Oh, that was excellent. She’d never been hospitalized. Fainted once at a wedding several years ago. Contraception? She took the pill. Wait a minute. About a month ago she told him she was stopping the pill. She’d read about how it was dangerous or something. He hadn’t thought much about it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">I gave Kathy massive amounts of tranquilizers and sedatives so that she was able to sleep at night, but during the next two days her behavior remained unchanged: incessant chanting, inability to communicate anything except the conviction of her imminent death, and unremitting terror. Finally, on the fourth day, I gave her an intravenous injection of sodium <span>amytal</span>. “This injection is going to make you sleepy Kathy,” I said, “but you will not fall asleep. Nor will you die. It will make you able to stop chanting. You will feel very relaxed. You will be able to talk with me. I want you to tell me what happened the morning you came to the hospital.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Nothing happened,” Kathy answered.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You drove your husband to work?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes. Then I drove home. Then I knew I was going to die.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You drove home just as you do every morning after you drop your husband at work?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Kathy began to chant again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Stop chanting, Kathy,” I ordered. “You’re completely safe. You’re feeling very relaxed. Something was different about the way you drove home that morning. You are going to tell me what was different.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I took a different road.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Why did you do that?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I took the road past Bill’s house.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Who’s Bill?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Kathy started chanting once more.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Is Bill a boyfriend of yours?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“He was. Before I got married.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You miss Bill a lot, don’t you?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Kathy wailed, “Oh, God, I’m going to die.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Did you see Bill that day?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“No.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“But you wanted to see him?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I’m going to die,” Kathy replied.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Do you feel that God is going to punish you for wanting to see Bill again?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“That’s why you believe you’re going to die?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes.” Once more Kathy started chanting. I let her chant for ten minutes while I collected my thoughts. .</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Finally I said to her, “Kathy, you believe you are going to die because you believe you know the mind of God. But you are wrong. Because you do not know the mind of God. All you know is what you have been told about God. Much of what you have been told about God is wrong. I do not know everything about God, but I know more than you do and more than the people who have told you about God. For instance, every day I see men and women, like yourself, who want to be unfaithful, and some are, and they are not punished by God. I know, because they keep coming back to see me. And talk with me. And they become happier. Just as you will become happier. Because we are going to work together. And you are going to learn that you’re not a bad person. And you’re going to learn the truth about yourself and about God. And you will become happier, about yourself and about life. But now you’re going to sleep. And when you awake you will no longer be afraid that you’re going to die. And when you see me tomorrow morning again, you will be able to talk with me, and we will talk about God and we will talk about yourself. “</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">In the morning Kathy was improved. She was still frightened and unconvinced that she would not die, but no longer certain that she would. Slowly, on that day and for many, many days thereafter, her story emerged, piece by piece. During her senior year in high school she had had sexual intercourse with Howard. He wanted to marry her and she had agreed. Two weeks later while at the wedding of a friend, the idea suddenly came to her that she did not want to get married. She fainted. Afterward she was confused as to whether she loved Howard. But she felt that she had to go through with the marriage because she knew she had already sinned by having premarital relations with him and this sin would be magnified if she did not consecrate their relationship in marriage. Still, she did not want children, at least not until she felt more certain that she loved Howard. So she started on the pill—another sin. She could not bear to confess these sins and was relieved to stop going to mass after they were married. She enjoyed sex with Howard. Almost from the day of their wedding, however, he lost interest in her sexually. He remained an ideal provider, buying her gifts, treating her deferentially, working a great deal of overtime, not allowing her to have a job. But she almost had to beg him for sex, and the sex they had every two weeks was about all there was to relieve her unremitting boredom. Divorce was out; <span class="italic">that</span> was a sin, unthinkable.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Despite herself Kathy began to have fantasies of sexual infidelity. She thought perhaps she might rid herself of these if she prayed more, so she started to pray ritualistically five minutes every hour. Then Howard noticed and teased her about it. So she decided to hide her praying by doing it more in the daytime when Howard was not home, to make up for not doing it in the evening when he was. This meant she had to pray either more frequently or faster. She decided to do both. She prayed now every half hour, and in her five minutes of praying time she doubled her speed. The fantasies of infidelity continued, however, and gradually became even more frequent and insistent. Whenever she went outside she looked at men. That made things worse. She became fearful of going outside with Howard, and even when she was with him, she became frightened of public places where she might see men. She thought perhaps she ought to return to church. But then she realized that if she returned to church she would be sinning if she did not go to confession and confess her fantasies of infidelity to the priest. This she could not do. She again doubled the speed of her praying. To facilitate this she began to develop an elaborate system in which a single chanted syllable stood for an entire particular prayer. This was the genesis of her chanting. In a while, perfecting her system, she was able to chant a thousand prayers in a five-minute period. Initially, while she was so busy perfecting her chanting, the fantasies of infidelity seemed to abate, but once she had the system down pat they returned full force. She began to consider how she might actually carry them out. She thought of calling Bill, her old boyfriend. She thought of bars she might go to in the afternoon. Terrified that she might really do this, she stopped taking the pill, hoping that the fear of getting pregnant would help her in resisting such acts. But the desire kept growing stronger. One afternoon she found herself starting to masturbate. She was horrified. That was perhaps the worst sin of all. She’d heard of cold showers and took one as cold as she could stand. It helped her until Howard came home. But the next day it was all back again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Finally, that last morning, she gave in. After dropping Howard off at work she drove directly to Bill’s house. She parked right in front. She waited. Nothing happened. No one seemed to be home. She got out of the car and stood leaning against it, in a seductive pose. “Please,” she pleaded silently, “please let Bill see me, please let him notice me.” Still nothing happened. “Please let someone see me, anyone. I’ve got to fuck someone. Oh, God, I’m a whore. I’m the Whore of Babylon. O God, kill me, I’ve got to die.” She jumped in the car and raced back to the apartment. She got a razor blade and went to cut her wrist. She could not do it. But God could. God would. God would give her what she deserved. He would put an end to it, an end to her. Let the vigil begin. “O God, I’m so scared, I’m so scared, please hurry, I’m so scared.” She began to chant, waiting. And that was how her sister-in-law found her.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">This story was elicited in its entirety only after months of painstaking work. Much of this work centered around the concept of sin. Where did she learn that masturbation is a sin? Who had told her it was a sin? How did her informant know it was a sin? What made masturbation a sin? Why is infidelity a sin? What makes a sin? And so on, and so on. I know of no profession more exciting and more privileged than the practice of psychotherapy, but at times it may be almost tedious as the attitudes of a lifetime are methodically challenged one by one in all their particulars. Often such challenge is at least partly successful even before the whole story emerges. For instance, Kathy was able to tell me about many of these details, such as her fantasies and her temptation to masturbation, only after she herself had begun to question the validity of her guilt and her conception of these acts as sins. In raising these questions it was also necessary that she question the validity of the authority and wisdom of the whole Catholic Church, or at least the church as she had experienced it. One does not take on the Catholic Church easily. She could do so only because she had the strength of an ally in me, because she had gradually come to feel that I was truly on her side, truly had her best interests at heart and would not lead her into evil. This “therapeutic alliance,” such as she and I had slowly constructed is a prerequisite for all successful major psychotherapy.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Much of this work was conducted on an outpatient basis. Kathy had been able to be discharged from the hospital a week following her sodium <span>amytal</span> interview. But it was only after four months of intensive therapy that she was able to say in regard to her notions of sin, “I guess the Catholic Church sold me a bill of goods.” At this point a new phase of therapy was begun, for we began to ask the question: How was it that this had happened? Why had she allowed herself to buy this bill of goods, lock, stock and barrel? How was it that she had not been able to think more for herself and had not until now challenged the church in any way? “But Mother told me I should not question the church,” Kathy said. And so we began to work on Kathy’s relationship with her parents. With her father there was no relationship. There was no one to relate to. Father worked; that was all he did. He worked and he worked, and when he came home it was to sleep in his chair with his beer. Except on Friday nights. Then he went out for his beer. Mother ran the family. Alone, unchallenged, <span>uncontradicted</span>, unopposed, she ran it. She was kind but firm. She was giving but never gave in. Peaceful and implacable. “You mustn’t do that, dear. Good girls don’t do that.” “You don’t want to wear those shoes, dear. Girls from nice homes don’t wear those kind of shoes.” “It isn’t a question of whether you want to go to mass, dear. The Lord wants us to go to mass.” Gradually Kathy came to see that behind the power of the Catholic Church lay the enormous power of her mother, a person so softly yet so totally domineering that it seemed unthinkable to defy her.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">But psychotherapy seldom goes smoothly. Six months after she had left the hospital Howard called one Sunday morning to say that Kathy was locked in the bathroom of their apartment chanting once again. Upon my instructions he persuaded her to return to the hospital, where I met them. Kathy was almost as frightened as the first day I saw her. Once again Howard had no clue as to what had set it off. I took Kathy into her room. “Stop chanting,” I ordered, “and tell me what’s the matter.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I can’t.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes, you can, Kathy.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Hardly catching her breath in between her chanting, she suggested, “Maybe I can if you give me the truth drug again.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“No, Kathy,” I replied. “This time you’re strong enough to do It yourself.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">She wailed. Then she looked at me and resumed her chanting. But in her look I thought I detected anger, almost fury, at me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You’re angry at me,” I stated.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">She shook her head as she chanted </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Kathy,” I said, “I can think of a dozen reasons why you might be angry at me. But I don’t know unless you tell me. You can tell me. It will be all right.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I’m going to die,” she moaned.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“No, you’re not, Kathy. You’re not going to die because you’re angry at me. I’m not going to kill you because you’re angry at me. It’s all right for you to be angry at me.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“My days are not long,” Kathy moaned. “My days are not long.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Something about these words sounded strange to me. They were not the words I would have expected. Somehow they seemed unnatural. But I was not sure what to say except to repeat myself one way or another.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Kathy, I love you,” I said. “I love you even if you hate me. That’s what love is. How could I punish you for hating me, since I love you, hating and all?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“It’s not you I hate,” she sobbed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Suddenly it clicked. “Your days are not long. Not long on this earth. That’s it, isn’t it, Kathy? Honor your mother and your father that your days may be long on this earth. The Fifth Commandment. Honor them or die. That’s what’s happening, isn’t it?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I hate her,” Kathy muttered. Then louder, as if emboldened by the sound of her own voice saying the dreaded words, “I hate her. I hate my mother. I hate her. She never gave me... she never gave me... she never gave me <span><span class="italic">me</span></span>. She never let me be me. She made me in her image. She made me, made me, made me. She never let any of me be me.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Actually, Kathy’s therapy was still in its early stages. The real day-to-day terror still lay ahead, the terror of being truly herself in a thousand little ways. Recognizing the fact that her mother had totally dominated her, Kathy then had to deal with why she had allowed this to happen. Rejecting her mother’s domination, she had to face the process of establishing her own values and making her own decisions, and she was very frightened. It was much safer to let her mother make the decisions, much simpler to adopt her mother’s values and those of the church. It took much more work to direct her own existence. Later Kathy was to say, “You know, I wouldn’t really trade places for anything with the person I used to be, yet sometimes I still long for those days. My life used to be easier then. At least in a way.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Beginning to function more independently, Kathy confronted Howard with his failure as a lover. Howard promised he would change. But nothing happened. Kathy pressed him. He began to get anxiety attacks. On my urging, when he came to me about these, he went to another psychotherapist for treatment. He started to deal with deep-seated homosexual feelings, against which he had defended himself by his marriage to Kathy. Because she was very physically attractive he had regarded her as a “real catch,” a prize the winning of which would prove to himself and the world his masculine competence. In a meaningful way he had never loved her. Having come to accept this, he and Kathy most amicably agreed to a divorce. Kathy went to work as a saleswoman in a large clothing store. With me she agonized over the innumerable small but independent decisions she was required to make in connection with her job. Gradually she became more assertive and confident. She dated many men, intending eventual remarriage and motherhood, but for the time being enjoying her career. She became an assistant buyer for the store. After terminating therapy she was promoted to buyer, and most recently I heard from her that she had moved to another larger firm in the same capacity, and was quite pleased with herself at the age of twenty-seven. She does not go to church and no longer considers herself a Catholic. She doesn’t know whether .she believes in God or not, but will tell you frankly that the issue of God just doesn’t seem a very important one at this point in her life.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">I have .described Kathy’s case at such length precisely because it is so typical of the relationship between religious upbringing and psychopathology. There are millions of <span>Kathys</span>. I used to tell people only somewhat facetiously that the Catholic Church provided me with my living as a psychiatrist. I could equally well have said the Baptist Church, Lutheran Church, Presbyterian Church, or any other. The church was not, of course, the sole cause of Kathy’s neurosis. In a sense the church was only a tool used by Kathy’s mother to cement and augment her excessive parental authority. One could justifiably say that the mother’s domineering nature, abetted by an absentee father, was the more basic cause of the neurosis, and in this respect too Kathy’s case was typical. Nonetheless, the church must share the blame. No nun in her parochial school and no priest in her catechism class ever encouraged Kathy to reasonably question religious doctrine or in any way whatever to think for herself. There was never any evidence of concern on the part of the church that its doctrine might be <span>overtaught</span>, unrealistically rigid or subject to misuse and misapplication. One way of analyzing Kathy’s problem would be to state that while she believed wholeheartedly in God, the commandments and the concept of sin, her religion and understanding of the world was of the hand-me-down variety and badly suited to her needs. She had failed to question, to challenge, to think for herself. Yet Kathy’s church—and this also is typical—made not the slightest effort to assist her in working out a more appropriate and original personal religion. It would appear that churches generally, if anything, favor the hand-me-down variety.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Because Kathy’s case is so typical and others like it are so common in their practice, many psychiatrists and psychotherapists perceive religion as the enemy. They .may even think of religion as being itself a neurosis—a collection of inherently irrational ideas that serve to enchain people’s minds and oppress their instincts toward mental growth. Freud, a rationalist and scientist par excellence, seemed to see things in roughly this light, and since he is the most influential figure in modern psychiatry (for many good reasons), his attitudes have contributed to the concept of religion as a neurosis. It is indeed tempting for psychiatrists to view themselves as knights of modern science locked in noble combat with the destructive forces of ancient religious superstition and irrational but authoritarian dogma.<span>  </span>And the fact of the matter is that psychotherapists must spend enormous amounts of time and effort in the struggle to liberate their patients’ minds from outdated religious ideas and concepts that are clearly destructive.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre7" id="toc_4"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre4">The Case of Marcia</span></span></span></span></p>
<span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre4"><br clear="all" class="calibre1"/></span></span></span>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre4"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">But not all cases are like Kathy’s by any means. There are many other patterns, some also quite common. Marcia was one of the very first of my long-term-therapy cases. She was a quite wealthy young woman in her mid-twenties who sought my attention because of a generalized <span>anhedonia</span>. While she could not put her finger on anything wrong with her existence, she found it inexplicably joyless. Certainly she looked joyless. Despite her wealth and her college education she looked like an impoverished, bedraggled and aged immigrant woman. Throughout the first year of therapy she invariably dressed in badly fitting clothes of blue, gray, black or brown, and carried with her an enormous, filthy and ragged carpetbag of similar hue. She was the only child of intellectual parents, both highly successful university professors, both socialists of a sort who believed that religion was “pie in the sky by and by.” They had made fun of her when, as a young adolescent, she had attended church with a girl friend. By the time she entered therapy, Marcia agreed with her parents wholeheartedly. At the very beginning she announced, somewhat proudly and stridently, that she was an atheist—not a namby-pamby atheist but a real one, who believed that the human race would be much better off if it could escape from the delusion that God existed or even might exist. Interestingly, Marcia’s dreams were chock-full of religious symbols, such as birds flying into rooms, their beaks holding scrolls upon which obscure messages were written in an ancient language. But I did not confront Marcia with this aspect of her unconscious. Indeed, we did not deal at all with issues of religion at any time throughout the two-year course of her therapy. What we primarily focused on at great length was her relationship with her parents, two most intelligent and rational individuals who had provided well for her economically but were extraordinarily distant from her emotionally in their intellectually austere way. In addition to their emotional distance, both of them were also so highly invested in their own careers that they had little time or energy for her. The result was that while she had a comfortable and intact home, Marcia was the proverbial “poor little rich girl,” a psychological orphan. But she was reluctant to look at this. She resented it when I suggested that her parents had significantly deprived her and she resented it when I pointed out that she dressed like an orphan. It was just the new style, she said, and I had no right to criticize it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Progress with Marcia in therapy was painfully gradual, but dramatic. The key element was the warmth and closeness. of the relationship that we were slowly able to construct with each other which contrasted with the relationship she had had with her parents. One morning at the beginning of the second year of therapy Marcia came into her session carrying a new bag. It was but a third the size of her old carpetbag and was a riot of bright colors. Thereafter about once each month she would add a new piece of color—bright oranges, yellows, light blues and greens—to her wardrobe, almost like a flower slowly unfolding its petals. In her next-to-last session with me she was musing about how well she felt and said, “You know, it’s strange, but not only has the inside of me changed; everything outside of me seems to have changed too. Even though I’m still here, living in the same old house and doing .some of the same old things, the whole world looks very different, feels very different. It feels warm and safe and loving and exciting and good. I remember telling you I was an atheist. I’m not sure I am any more. In fact, I don’t think I am. Sometimes now when the world feels right, I say to myself, ‘You know, I bet there really is a God. I don’t think the world could be so right without a God.’ It’s funny. I don’t know how to talk about this sort of thing. I just feel connected, real, like I’m a real part of a very big picture, and even though I can’t see much of the picture, I know it’s there and I know it’s good and I know I’m a part of it.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Through therapy Kathy moved from a place where the notion of God was all-important to a place where it was of no importance. Marcia, on the other hand, moved from a position where she rejected the notion of God to one where it was becoming quite meaningful for her. The same process, the same therapist, yet with seemingly opposite results, both successful. How are we to explain this? Before we attempt to do so, let us consider yet another type of case. In Kathy’s case it was necessary for the therapist to actively challenge her religious ideas in order to bring about change in the direction of a dramatically diminished influence of the God-concept in her life. In the case of Marcia the concept of God began to assume an increased influence, but without the therapist ever challenging her religious concepts in any way. Is it ever necessary, we may ask, for a therapist to actively challenge a patient’s atheism or agnosticism and deliberately lead the patient in the direction of religiosity?</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Ted was thirty when he came to see me, and a hermit. For the preceding seven years he had lived in a small cabin deep m the woods. He had few friends and no one close. For three years he had not dated. Occasionally he performed minor carpentry jobs, but mostly he filled his days by fishing, reading and spending endless time making unimportant decisions, such as what he would cook for dinner and how he might cook it or whether he could or could not afford to purchase an inexpensive tool. Actually, by virtue of an inheritance he was quite wealthy. He was also intellectually brilliant. And, as he said that first session, paralyzed. “I know I should be doing something more constructive and creative with my life,” he complained, “but I can’t even make the most minor decisions, much less big ones. I ought to have a career. I ought to go to graduate school and learn some kind of occupation, but I. can’t get enthusiastic about anything. I’ve thought of everything—teaching , scholarly work, international relations, medicine, agriculture, ecology—but <span> </span>nothing turns me on. I may get interested in it for a day or two, but then every field seems to have insurmountable problems. Life seems to be an insurmountable problem.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">His problem began, Ted said, when he was eighteen and entered college. Until then everything had been fine. He had had basically an ordinary childhood in a stable well-to-do home with two older brothers; parents who cared for him even if they didn’t care much for each other; good grades and satisfactions in a private boarding school. Then—and perhaps this was crucial—came a passionate love affair with a woman who rejected him the week before he entered college. Dejected, he had spent most of his freshman year drunk. Still, he maintained good grades. Then he had several other love affairs, each one more halfhearted and unsuccessful than the last. His grades began to slip. He could not decide what to write papers about. A close friend, Hank, was killed in an automobile accident in the middle of his junior year, but he’d gotten over it. He even stopped drinking that year. But the problem with decision-making became still worse. He simply could not choose a topic on which to write his senior thesis. He finished his course work. He rented an off-campus room. All he needed to graduate was to submit a short thesis, the kind of thing one could do in a month. It took him the following three years. Then, nothing. Seven years before, he had come here to the woods.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Ted felt certain that his problem was rooted in his sexuality. After all, his difficulties had begun, had they not, with an unsuccessful love affair? Besides, he had read almost everything that Freud had ever written (and much more than I myself had read). So during the first six months of therapy we plumbed the depths of his childhood sexuality, getting nowhere in particular. But in that period several interesting facets of his personality did emerge. One was his total lack of enthusiasm. He might wish for good weather, but when it came he would shrug his shoulders and say, “It doesn’t really make any difference. Basically one day’s just like the next.” Fishing in the lake, he caught an enormous pike, “But it was more than I could eat and I have no friends to share it with, so I threw it back.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Related to this lack of enthusiasm was a kind of global snobbishness, as if he found the world and all that was in it to be in poor taste. His was the <span>critics’s</span> eye. I came to suspect he employed this snobbishness to keep a kind of distance between himself and things that might otherwise affect him emotionally. Finally, Ted had an enormous penchant for secrecy, which made therapy very slow going indeed. The most important facts of any incident had to be pried out of him. He had a dream: “I was in a classroom. There was an object—I don’t know what—which I had placed inside a box. I had built the box around the object so that no one could tell what was inside it. I had placed the box inside a dead tree, and with finely fashioned wooden screws had replaced the bark over the box. But sitting in the classroom I suddenly remembered that I had not been certain to make the screws flush with the bark. I became quite anxious. So I rushed out to the woods and worked the screws so that no one could distinguish them from the bark. Then I felt better and came back to class.” As with many people, class and classroom were symbols for therapy in Ted’s dreams. It was clear he did not want me to find the core of his neurosis.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">The first small chink in Ted’s armor occurred during one session in the sixth month of therapy. He had spent the evening before at the house of an acquaintance. “It was a dreadful evening,” Ted lamented. “He wanted me to listen to this new record he’d bought, Neil Diamond’s sound track for the movie of <span class="italic">Jonathan Livingston Seagull</span>. It was excruciating. I do not understand how educated people can actually enjoy such putrid mucilage or even call it music.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">The intensity of his snobbish reaction caused me to pick up my ears. “<span class="italic">Jonathan Livingston Seagull</span> was a religious book,” I commented. “Was the music also religious?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I suppose you could call it religious as much as you could call it music.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Perhaps it was the religion that offended you,” I suggested, “and not so much the music.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Well, I certainly do find that kind of religion offensive, Ted replied.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“What kind of religion is that kind?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Sentimental. Mawkish.” Ted almost spat the words out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“What other kind of religion is there?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Ted looked puzzled, disconcerted. “Not much, I guess. I guess I generally find religion unappealing.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Has it always been that way?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">He laughed ruefully. “No, when I was a fuzzy-brained adolescent I was quite into religion. My senior year of boarding school I was even a deacon of the little church we had.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Then what?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Then what <span>what</span>?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Well, what happened to your religion?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I just grew out of it, I guess.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“How did you grow out of it?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“What do you mean, how did I grow out of it?” Ted was clearly becoming irritated now. “How does one grow out of anything? I just did, that’s all.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“When did you grow out of it?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know. It just happened. I told you. I never went to church in college.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Never?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Never once.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“So your senior year of high school you’re a deacon in the church,” I commented. “Then that summer you have an unsuccessful love affair. And then you never go to church again. It was an abrupt change. You don’t suppose your girlfriend’s rejection had anything to do with it, do you?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I don’t suppose anything. The same pattern was true of lots of my classmates. We were coming of age in a time when religion wasn’t fashionable anyway. Maybe my girlfriend had something to do with it, maybe she didn’t. How should I know? All I know is I just became uninterested in religion.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">The next break came a month later. We had been focusing on Ted’s notable lack of enthusiasm about anything, which he readily acknowledged. “The last time I can distinctly remember being enthusiastic,” he said, “was ten years ago, in my junior year. It was over a paper I was writing at the end of a fall semester course in modem British poetry.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“What was the paper about?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I really don’t think I can remember, it was so long ago.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Poppycock,” I said. “You can remember if you want to.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Well, I think it had to do with Gerard Manley Hopkins. He was one of the first of the truly modem poets. ‘Pied Beauty’ was probably the poem it centered on.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">I left the office, went to my library, and came back with a dusty volume of British poetry from my college years. “Pied Beauty” was there on page 819. I read: </span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Tears came to my eyes. “It is, itself, a poem about enthusiasm,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes. “</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“It’s also a very religious poem.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You wrote the paper on it at the end of the fall semester. That would have been January?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes. “</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“If I calculate correctly, it was in the next month, February, that your friend Hank died.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">I could feel an incredible tension growing. I was not sure what was the right thing to do. Hoping, I ploughed ahead. “So you were rejected by your first real girl friend at seventeen and you gave up your enthusiasm for the church. Three years later your best friend died and you gave up your enthusiasm for everything.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I didn’t give it up, it was taken from me.” Ted was almost shouting now, more emotional than I had ever seen him.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“God rejected you so you rejected God.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Well, why shouldn’t I?” he demanded. “It’s a shitty world. It’s always been a shitty world.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I thought your childhood was quite happy.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“No, that was shitty too.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">And so it was. Underneath its calm exterior Ted’s childhood home had been a continual bloody battleground for him. His two older brothers had picked on him with unparalleled viciousness. His parents, too involved in their own affairs and their hatred of each other to concern themselves with the seemingly minor problems of children, had offered him, the smallest and the weakest, no protection. Escape to the countryside for long, solitary walks was his greatest solace, and we were able to establish that his hermitlike pattern had its roots in the years before he was even ten. Boarding school, with its minor cruelties, had been a relief. As he talked of these things, Ted’s resentment of the world—or rather his ventilation of that resentment—gathered momentum. In the months that followed he relived not only the pain of his childhood and the pain of Hank’s death but also the pain of a thousand smaller deaths and rejections and losses. All of life seemed a maelstrom of death and suffering, danger and savagery.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">After fifteen months of therapy there came a turning point. Ted brought into his session a little book. “You’re always talking about how secretive I am—and, of course, I am,” he said. “Last night I was rummaging through some old stuff and I found this journal that I kept during my sophomore year at college. I haven’t even looked at it to censor it. I thought perhaps you might like to read the unexpurgated me of a decade ago.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">I said I would, and I did for the next two nights. Actually, it was hardly revelatory except to confirm that his pattern as a loner, isolated by a snobbishness born of hurt, was deeply entrenched even then. But one little vignette caught my eye. He described how he had gone hiking alone on a Sunday in January and had been caught in a heavy snowstorm and had gotten back to his dormitory several hours after dark. “I felt a certain sense of exhilaration,” he had written, “upon my return to the safety of my room, not unlike that which I experienced last summer when I came so near to death.” The next day in our session I asked him to tell me how he had come near to death.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Oh, I’ve told you about that,” Ted said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">By this time I knew well that whenever Ted proclaimed he had already told me something, he was trying to hide it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You’re being secretive again,” I responded.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Well, I’m sure I told you. I must have. Anyway, there wasn’t all that much to it. You remember I worked in Florida that summer between my freshman and sophomore years. There was a hurricane. I kind of like storms, you know. At the height of the storm I went out on a pier. A wave washed me off. Then another washed me back on. That was all there was to it. It was over very quickly.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You went out to the end of a pier at the height of a hurricane?” I asked incredulously.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I told you. I like storms. I wanted to be close to that elemental fury.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I can understand that,” I said. “We both like storms. But I don’t know that I would have put myself in jeopardy like that. “</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Well, you know I have a suicidal streak,” Ted replied almost impishly. “And I was certainly feeling suicidal that summer. I’ve analyzed it. Frankly, I can’t remember going out on the pier with any conscious suicidal intent. But I certainly didn’t care much about life and I acknowledge the possibility that I was being suicidal.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You were washed off?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes. I hardly knew what was happening. There was so much spray you really couldn’t see much of anything. I guess a particularly big wave came. I felt it slam into me, felt myself swept away, felt myself lost in the water. There was nothing I could do to save myself. I was certain I was going to die. I felt terrified. After about a minute I felt myself tossed backward by the water—it must have been some kind of backwash wave—and a second later I was slammed down against the concrete of the pier. I crawled to the side of the pier, gripped it , and hand over hand I crawled back to the land. I was a bit bruised. That was all.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“How do you feel about the experience?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“What do you mean, how do I feel about it?” Ted asked in his resisting way.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Just what I asked. How do you feel about it?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You mean about being saved?” he queried.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes. “</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Well, I guess I feel I was fortunate.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Fortunate?” I queried. “Just an unusual coincidence, that backwash wave?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes, that’s all.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Some might call it miraculous,” I commented.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I guess I was lucky.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You guess you were lucky,” I repeated, goading him.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes, goddammit, I guess I was lucky.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“It’s interesting, Ted,” I said, “that whenever something significantly painful happens to you, you rail against God, you rail against what a shitty, terrible world it is. But when something good happens to you, you guess you’re lucky. A minor tragedy and it’s God’s fault. A miraculous blessing and it’s a bit lucky. What do you make of that?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Confronted with the inconsistency of his attitude toward good and bad fortune, Ted began to focus more and more on things that were right with the world, on the sweet as well as the sour, the dazzle as well as the dim. Having worked through the pain of Hank’s death and the other deaths he had experienced, he began to examine the other side of the coin of life. He came to accept the necessity of suffering and to embrace the paradoxical nature of existence, the “dappled things.” This acceptance occurred, of course, in the context of a warm, loving and increasingly pleasurable relationship between us. He began to move out. Very tentatively, he started dating again. He began to express faint enthusiasm. His religious nature blossomed. Everywhere he looked he saw the mystery of life and death, of creation and decay and regeneration. He read theology. He listened to <span class="italic">Jesus Christ, Superstar</span>, to <span><span class="italic">Godspell</span></span>, and even bought his own copy of <span class="italic">Jonathan Livingston Seagull</span>. After two years of therapy Ted announced one morning that the time had come for him to get on with it. “I’ve been thinking about applying to a graduate school in psychology,” he said. “I know you’re going to say that I’m just imitating you, but I’ve looked at that and I don’t think that’s it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Go on,” I requested.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Well, in thinking about this it seemed to me I ought to try to do what is most important. If I am going back to school I want to study the most important things.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Go on.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“So I decided that the human mind is important. And doing therapy is important.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“The human mind and psychotherapy, that’s the most important thing?” I queried.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Well, I suppose God is the most important thing.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“So why don’t you study God?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“What do you mean?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“If God is the most important thing, why don’t you study God?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I’m sorry. I simply don’t understand you,” Ted said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“That’s because you’re blocking yourself from understanding,” I replied.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Really, I don’t understand. How can one study God?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“One studies psychology in a school. One studies God in a school,” I answered.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You mean theology school?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You mean, become a minister?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Yes.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Oh, no, I couldn’t do that.” Ted was aghast.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Why not?” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Ted became shifty. “There isn’t necessarily any difference between a psychotherapist and a minister. I mean, ministers do lots of therapy. And doing psychotherapy, well, it’s like a ministry. “</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“So why couldn’t you become a minister?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“You’re pressuring me,” Ted fumed. “A career is my personal decision. It’s up to me to go into the career I want. Therapists aren’t supposed to direct patients. It’s not your role to make choices for me. I’ll make my own choices.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Look,” I said, “I am not making any choice for you. I am in this instance being purely analytical. I am analyzing the alternatives open to you. You are the one who for some reason does not want to look at one of those alternatives. You are the one who wants to do the most important thing. You are the one who feels that God is the most important thing. Yet when I drag you to finally look at the alternative of a career in God, you exclude it. You say you couldn’t do it. Fine if you can’t do it. But it <span class="italic">is</span> my province to be interested in why you feel you can’t do it, why you exclude it as an alternative.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I just couldn’t be a minister,” Ted said lamely.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Why not?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Because... because to be a minister one is publicly a man of God. I mean, I’d have to go public with my belief in God: I’d have to be publicly enthusiastic about it. I just couldn’t do that.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“No, you’ve got to be secret, don’t you?” I said. “That’s your neurosis and you’ve got to keep it. You can’t be publicly enthusiastic. You’ve got to keep your enthusiasm in the closet, don’t you?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“Look,” Ted wailed, “you don’t know what it’s like for me. You don’t know what it’s like to be me. Every time I opened my mouth to be enthusiastic about something my brothers would tease me for it. “</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“So I guess you’re still ten years old,” I remarked, “and your brothers are still around.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Ted was actually crying now with frustration at me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“That’s not all,” he said, weeping. “That’s how my parents punished me. Whenever I did something wrong they took what I loved away from me. ‘Let’s see, what is it that Ted’s most enthusiastic about? Oh, yes, the trip to his aunt’s next week. He’s really excited about that. So we’ll tell him that because he’s been bad he can’t go see his aunt. That’s it. Then there’s his bow and arrows. He really loves his bow and arrows. So we’ll take that away.’ Simple. Simple system. Everything I was enthusiastic about they took away. Everything I loved I lost.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">And so we arrived at the deepest core of Ted’s neurosis. Gradually, by act of will, continually having to remind himself that he was not still ten, that he was not still under the thumb of his parents or within striking distance of his brothers, bit by bit he forced himself to communicate his enthusiasm, his love of life and his love of God. He did decide to go on to divinity school A few weeks before he left I received a check from him for the previous month’s sessions. Something about it caught my eye. His signature seemed longer. I looked at it closely. Previously he had always signed his name “Ted.” Now it was “Theodore.” I called his attention to the change.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">“I was hoping you would notice it,” he said. “I guess in a way I’m still keeping secrets, aren’t I? When I was very young my aunt told me that I should be proud of the name Theodore because it means ‘lover of God.’ I was proud. So I told my brothers about it. Christ, did they make fun of me. They called me a sissy in ten different ways. ‘Sissy choir boy. Why don’t you go kiss the altar? Why don’t you go kiss the choirmaster?’“ Ted smiled. “You know the whole routine. So I became embarrassed by the name. A few weeks ago it occurred to me that I was no longer embarrassed. So I decided it was all right to use my full name now. After all, I am a lover of God, aren’t I?”</span></span></span></p>

<span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre4"><br clear="all" class="calibre1"/></span></span></span>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre4"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">The foregoing case histories were offered in response to a question: Is belief in God a form of psychopathology? If we are to rise out of the mire of childhood teaching, local tradition and superstition, it is a question that must be asked. But these case histories indicate that the answer is not a simple one. The answer sometimes is yes. Kathy’s unquestioning belief in the God her church and mother taught clearly retarded her growth and poisoned her spirit. Only by questioning and discarding her belief was she able to venture forth into a wider, more satisfying, more productive life. Only then was she free to grow. But the answer also is sometimes no. As Marcia grew out of the cold microcosm of her childhood into a larger, warmer world, a belief in God also grew within her, quietly and naturally. And Ted’s forsaken belief in God had to be resurrected as an essential part of the liberation and resurrection of his spirit.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">What are we to do with this yes-and-no answer? Scientists are dedicated to asking questions in the search for truth. But they too are human, and like all humans, they would like their answers to be clean and dear and easy. In their desire for simple solutions, scientists are prone to fall into two traps as they question the reality of God. The first is to throw the baby out with the bath water. And the second is tunnel vision.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">There is clearly a lot of dirty bath water surrounding the reality of God. Holy wars. Inquisitions. Animal sacrifice. Human sacrifice. Superstition. Stultification. Dogmatism. Ignorance. Hypocrisy. Self-righteousness. Rigidity. Cruelty. Book-burning. Witch-burning. Inhibition. Fear. Conformity. Morbid guilt. Insanity. The list is almost endless. But is all this what God has done to humans or what humans have done to God? It is abundantly evident that belief in God is often destructively dogmatic. Is the problem, then, that humans tend to believe in God, or is the problem that humans tend to be dogmatic? Anyone who has known a died-in-the-wool atheist will know that such an individual can be as dogmatic about unbelief as any believer can be about belief. Is it belief in God we need to get rid of, or is it dogmatism?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Another reason that scientists are so prone to throw the baby out with the bath water is that science itself, as I have suggested, is a religion. The neophyte scientist, recently come or converted to the world view of science, can be every bit as fanatical as a Christian crusader or a soldier of Allah. This is particularly the case when we have come to science from a culture and home in which belief in God is firmly associated with ignorance, superstition, rigidity and hypocrisy. Then we have emotional as well as intellectual motives to smash the idols of primitive faith. A mark of maturity in scientists, however, is their awareness that science may be as subject to dogmatism as any other religion.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">I have firmly stated that it is essential to our spiritual growth for us to become scientists who are skeptical of what we have been taught—that is, the common notions and assumptions of our culture. But the notions of science themselves often become cultural idols, and it is necessary that we become skeptical of these as well. It is indeed possible for us to mature out of a belief in God. What I would now like to suggest is that it is also possible to mature into a belief in God. A skeptical atheism or agnosticism is not necessarily the highest state of understanding at which human beings can arrive. To the contrary, there is reason to believe that behind spurious notions and false concepts of God there lies a reality that is God. This is what Paul Tillich meant when he referred to the “god beyond God” and why some sophisticated Christians used to proclaim joyfully, “God is dead. Long live God.” Is it possible that the path of spiritual growth leads first out of superstition into agnosticism and then out of agnosticism toward an accurate knowledge of God? It was of this path that the Sufi Aba Said <span>ibn</span>
<span>Abi</span>-I-<span>Khair</span> was speaking more than nine hundred years ago when he said:</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Whether or not the path of spiritual growth necessarily leads from a skeptical atheism or agnosticism toward an accurate belief in God, the fact of the matter is that some intellectually sophisticated and skeptical people, such as Marcia and Ted, do seem to grow in the direction of belief. And it should be noted that this belief into which they grew was not at all like that out of which Kathy evolved. The God that comes before skepticism may bear little resemblance to the God that comes after. As I mentioned at the beginning of this section, there is no single, monolithic religion. There are many religions, and perhaps many levels to belief. Some religions may be unhealthy for some people; others may be healthy.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">All this is of particular import for those scientists who are psychiatrists or psychotherapists. Dealing so directly with the growth process, they more than anyone else are called upon to make judgments as to the healthiness of an individual’s belief system. Because psychotherapists generally belong to a skeptical if not strictly Freudian tradition, there is a tendency for them to consider any passionate belief in God to be pathological. Upon occasion this tendency may go over the line into frank bias and prejudice. Not long ago I met a college senior who was giving serious consideration to the possibility of entering a monastery a few years hence. He had been in psychotherapy for the preceding year and was continuing. “But I have not been able to tell my therapist about the monastery or the depth of my religious belief,” he confided. “I don’t think he would understand.” I did not begin to know this young man well enough to assess the meaning that the monastery held for him or whether his desire to join it was neurotically determined. I very much would have liked to say to him: “You really ought to tell your therapist about it. It is essential for your therapy that you be open about everything, particularly a serious matter such as this. You should trust your therapist to be objective.” But I did not. For I was not at all sure that his therapist would be objective, that he would understand, in the true meaning of the word.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Psychiatrists and psychotherapists who have simplistic attitudes toward religion are likely to do a disservice to some of their patients. This will be true if they regard all religion as good or healthy. It will also be true if they throw out the baby with the bath water and regard all religion as sickness or the Enemy. And, finally, it will be true if in the face of the complexity of the matter they withdraw themselves from dealing at all with the religious issues of their patients, hiding behind a cloak of such total objectivity that they do not consider it to be their role to be, themselves, in any way spiritually or religiously involved. For their patients often need their involvement. I do not mean to imply that they should forsake their objectivity, or that balancing their objectivity with their own spirituality is an easy matter. It is not. To the contrary, my plea would be that psychotherapists of all kinds should push themselves to become not less involved but rather more sophisticated in religious matters than they frequently are.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre7" id="toc_7"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre4">Scientific Tunnel Vision</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Occasionally psychiatrists encounter patients with a strange disturbance of vision; these patients are able to see only a very narrow area directly in front of them. They cannot see anything to the left or to the right, above or below their narrow focus. They cannot see two objects adjacent to each other at the same time, they can see only one thing at a time and must turn their heads if they are to see another. They liken this symptom to looking down a tunnel being able to see only a small circle of light and clarity at the end. No physical disturbance in their visual system can be found to account for the symptom. It is as if for some reason they do not want to see more than immediately meets the eye, more than what they choose to focus their attention upon.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Another major reason that scientists are prone to throw the baby out with the bath water is that they do not see the baby. Many scientists simply do not look at the evidence of the reality of God. They suffer from a kind of tunnel vision, a psychologically self-imposed psychological set of blinders which prevents them from turning their attention to the realm of the spirit.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Among the causes of this scientific tunnel vision I would like to discuss two that result from the nature of scientific tradition. The first of these is an issue of methodology. In its laudable insistence upon experience, accurate observation and verifiability, science has placed great emphasis upon measurement. To measure something is to experience it in a certain dimension, a dimension in which we can make observations of great accuracy which are repeatable by others. The use of measurement has enabled science to make enormous strides in the understanding of the material universe. But by virtue of its success, measurement has become a kind of scientific idol. The result is an attitude on the part of many scientists of not only skepticism but outright rejection of what cannot be measured. It is as if they were to say, “What we cannot measure, we cannot know; there is no point in worrying about what we cannot know; therefore, what cannot be measured is unimportant and unworthy of our observation.” Because of this attitude many scientists exclude from their serious consideration all matters that are—or seem to be—intangible. Including, of course, the matter of God.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">This strange but remarkably common assumption that things that are not easy to study do not merit study is beginning to be challenged by several relatively recent developments within science itself. One is the development of increasingly sophisticated methods of study. Through the use of hardware such as electron microscopes, spectrophotometers and computers, and software such as statistical techniques we are now able to make measurements of increasingly complex phenomena which a few decades ago were <span>unmeasurable</span>. The range of scientific vision is consequently expanding. As it continues to expand, perhaps we shall soon be able to say: “There is nothing beyond the limits of our vision. If we decide to study something, we can always find the methodology with which to do it.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">The other development that is assisting us to escape from scientific tunnel vision is the relatively recent discovery by science of the reality of paradox. A hundred years ago paradox meant error to the scientific mind. But exploring such phenomena as the nature of light, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics and relativity theory, physical science has matured over the past century to the point where it is increasingly recognized that at a certain level reality is paradoxical. Thus J. Robert Oppenheimer wrote: </span></span></span></p>

<blockquote class="calibre6"><p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">To what appear to be the simplest questions, we. will tend to give either no answer or an answer which will at first sight be reminiscent more of a strange catechism than of the straightforward affirmatives of physical science. If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say “no”; if we ask whether the electron’s position changes with time, we must say “no”; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say “no”; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say “no.” The Buddha has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of a man’s self after his death; but they are not the familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth century science. * </span></span></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Mystics have spoken to us through the ages in terms of paradox. Is it possible that we are beginning to see a meeting ground between science and religion? When we are able to say that “a human is both mortal and eternal at the same time” and “light is both a wave and a particle at the same time,” we have begun to speak the same language. Is it possible that the path of spiritual growth that proceeds from religious superstition to scientific skepticism may indeed ultimately lead us to a genuine, religious reality?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">This beginning possibility of unification of religion and science is the most significant and exciting happening in our intellectual life today. But it is only just beginning. For the most part both the religious and the scientific remain in self-imposed narrow frames of reference, each still largely blinded by its own particular type of tunnel vision. Examine, for instance, the behavior of both in regard to the question of miracles. Even the idea of a miracle is anathema to most scientists. Over the past four hundred years or so science has elucidated a number of “natural laws,” such as “Two objects attract each other in proportion to their mass and in inverse proportion to the distance between them” or “Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.” But having been successful in discovering natural laws, scientists in their world view have made an idol out of the concept of natural law, just as they made an idol out of the notion of measurement. The result is that any event that cannot be explained by currently understood natural law is assumed to be unreal by the scientific establishment. In regard to methodology, science has tended to say, “What is very difficult to study doesn’t merit study.” And in regard to natural law, science tends to say, “What is very difficult to understand doesn’t exist. “</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">The church has been a bit more broad-minded. To the religious establishment what cannot be understood in terms of known natural law is a miracle, and miracles do exist. But beyond authenticating their existence, the church has not been anxious to look at miracles very closely. “Miracles need not be scientifically examined” has been the prevailing religious attitude. “They should simply be accepted as acts of God.” The religious have not wanted their religion shaken by science, just as the scientific have not wanted their science to be shaken by religion. Events of miraculous healing, for instance, have been used by the Catholic Church to authenticate its saints, and they are almost standard fare for many Protestant denominations. Yet the churches have never said to physicians, “Would you join with us to study these most fascinating phenomena?” Nor have physicians said, “May we get together with you to examine scientifically these occurrences which should be of such interest to our profession?” Instead the attitude of the medical profession has been that miracle cures are nonexistent, that the disease of which a person was cured did not exist in the first place, either because it was an imaginary disorder, such as a hysterical conversion reaction, or else because it was a misdiagnosis. Fortunately, however, a few serious scientists, physicians and religious truth-seekers are currently in the process of beginning to examine the nature of such phenomena as spontaneous remissions in cancer patients and apparently successful examples of psychic healing.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Fifteen years ago, when I graduated from medical school, I was certain that there were no miracles. Today I am certain that miracles abound. This change in my consciousness has been the result of two factors working hand in hand. One factor is a whole variety of experiences I have had as a psychiatrist which initially seemed quite commonplace but which, when I thought about them more deeply, seemed to indicate that my work with patients toward their growth was being remarkably assisted in ways for which I had no logical explanation—that is, ways that were miraculous. These experiences, some of which I shall be recounting, led me to question my previous assumption that miraculous occurrences were impossible. Once I questioned this assumption I became open to the possible existence of the miraculous. This openness, which was the second factor causing my change in consciousness, then allowed me to begin routinely looking at ordinary existence with an eye for the miraculous. The more I looked, the more I found. If there were but one thing I could hope for from the reader of the remainder of this book, it would be that he or she possesses the capacity to perceive the miraculous. Of this capacity it has recently been written:</span></span></span></p>

<blockquote class="calibre6"><p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">Self-realization is born and matures in a distinctive kind of awareness, an awareness that has been described in many different ways by many different people. The mystics, for example, have spoken of it as the perception of the divinity and perfection of the world. Richard <span>Bucke</span> referred to it as cosmic consciousness; Buber described it in terms of the I-Thou relationship; and Maslow gave it the label “Being cognition”. We shall use <span>Ouspensky’s</span> term and call it the perception of the miraculous. “Miraculous” here refers not only to extraordinary phenomena but also to the commonplace, for. absolutely anything can evoke this special awareness provided that close enough attention is paid to it. Once perception is disengaged from the domination of preconception and personal interest, it is free to experience the world as it is in itself and to behold its inherent magnificence… Perception of the miraculous requires no faith or assumptions. It is simply a matter of paying full and close attention to the givens of life, i.e., to what is so ever-present that it is usually taken for granted. The true wonder of the world is available everywhere, in the minutest parts of our bodies, in the vast expanses of the cosmos, and in the intimate interconnectedness of these and all things… We are part of a finely balanced ecosystem in which interdependency goes hand-in-hand with individuation. We are all individuals, but we are also parts of a greater whole, united in something vast and beautiful beyond description. Perception of the miraculous is the subjective essence of self-realization, the root from which man’s highest features and experiences grow. *</span></span></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre11"></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">In thinking about miracles, I believe that our frame of reference has been too dramatic. We have been looking for the burning bush, the parting of the sea, the bellowing voice from heaven. Instead we should be looking at the ordinary day-to-day events in our lives for evidence of the miraculous, maintaining at the same time a scientific orientation. This is what I shall be doing in the next section as I examine ordinary occurrences in the practice of psychiatry which have led me to an understanding of .the extraordinary phenomenon of grace.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre3"><span><span class="calibre8">But I would like to conclude on another note of caution. This interface between science and religion can be shaky, dangerous ground. We shall be dealing with extrasensory perception and “psychic” or “paranormal” phenomena as well as other varieties of the miraculous. It is essential that we keep our wits about us. I recently attended a conference on the subject of faith healing at which a number of well-educated speakers presented anecdotal evidence to indicate that they or others were possessors of healing power in such a manner as to suggest their evidence to be rigorous and scientific when it was not. If a healer lays hands on a patient’s inflamed joint and the next day the joint is no longer inflamed, this does not mean that the patient has been healed by the healer. Inflamed joints usually become <span>uninflamed</span> sooner or later, slowly or suddenly, no matter what is done unto them. The fact that two events occur together in time does not necessarily mean that they are causally related. Because this whole area is so murky and ambiguous, it is all the more important that we approach it with healthy skepticism lest we mislead ourselves and others. Among the ways that others may be misled, for instance, is by perceiving the lack of skepticism and rigorous reality-testing so often present in those individuals who are public proponents of the reality of psychic phenomena. Such individuals give the field a bad name. Because the field of psychic phenomena attracts so many people with poor reality testing, it is tempting for more realistic observers to conclude that psychic phenomena themselves are unreal although such is not the case. There are many who attempt to find simple answers to hard questions, marrying popular scientific and religious concepts with high hopes but little thought. The fact that many such marriages fail should not be taken to mean that marriage is either impossible or inadvisable. But just as it is essential that our sight not be crippled by scientific tunnel vision, so also is it essential that our critical faculties and capacity for skepticism not be blinded by the brilliant beauty of the spiritual realm.</span></span></span></p>
